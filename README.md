# üõ†Ô∏è CSE310 Compiler

A full compiler for a subset of the C programming language, built as part of the **CSE310: Compiler Design** course. This project implements the complete compilation pipeline‚Äîfrom tokenizing to code generation‚Äîwith a strong focus on educational clarity and modular design.

---

## Features

- **Symbol Table** implemented in modern **C++**
- **Lexical Analysis** using [Flex (yyFlex)](https://github.com/westes/flex)
- **Parsing** with [ANTLR4](https://www.antlr.org/) (C++ implementation)
- **Intermediate Code Generation** (ICG) using ANTLR visitors
- **Final Code Output** in **x86 Assembly**
- Supports generation of `.asm` files executable in emulators (e.g. EMU8086 / DOSBox)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Put your input file inside ICG/input
3. Follow this [pdf](antlr_setup.pdf) to setup antlr4 inside a venv
4. Activate the venv
5. Compile using 
```
bash run-script.sh input/input.c
```
6. The output assembly is in ICG/output/code.asm
7. This assembly can be run in EMU8086
8. Clear the output and other files using
```
bash clean-script.sh
```

## Example

Here's a simple C-like program compiled using our compiler:

### Input (C-like Source Code)
```c
int main() {
    int a = 5;
    int b = 3;
    int c = a + b;
    println(c);
}
```

### Output (x8086 Assembly)
```
.MODEL SMALL
.STACK 1000H
.DATA
    number DB "00000$"
.CODE
main PROC
    MOV AX, @DATA
    MOV DS, AX
    PUSH BP
    MOV BP, SP
    SUB SP, 2
    MOV AX, 5
    PUSH AX
    SUB SP, 2
    MOV AX, 3
    PUSH AX
    SUB SP, 2
    MOV AX, [BP - 2]
    PUSH AX
    MOV AX, [BP - 4]
    PUSH AX
    POP BX
    POP AX
    ADD AX, BX
    PUSH AX
    MOV AX, [BP - 6]
    CALL print_output
    CALL new_line
:
    ADD SP, 6
    POP BP
    MOV AX, 4CH
    INT 21H
main ENDP

print_output proc
    push ax
    push bx
    push cx
    push dx
    push si
    lea si,number
    mov bx,10
    add si,4
    cmp ax,0
    jnge negate
print:
    xor dx,dx
    div bx
    mov [si],dl
    add [si],'0'
    dec si
    cmp ax,0
    jne print
    inc si
    lea dx,si
    mov ah,9
    int 21h
    pop si
    pop dx
    pop cx
    pop bx
    pop ax
    ret
negate:
    push ax
    mov ah,2
    mov dl,'-'
    int 21h
    pop ax
    neg ax
    jmp print
print_output endp

new_line proc
    push ax
    push dx
    mov ah,2
    mov dl,0Dh
    int 21h
    mov ah,2
    mov dl,0Ah
    int 21h
    pop dx
    pop ax
    ret
new_line endp

END main
```

## What I Learned

- Implementing a multi-stage compiler with real tools (Flex, ANTLR, x86)
- Designing grammar rules and resolving ambiguities
- Managing memory and scopes using custom symbol tables
- Generating working 8086 assembly code for real emulators
- Writing automation scripts to streamline the toolchain

## Acknowledgements

This project would not have been possible without the knowledge, support, and guidance of the following individuals and communities:

- **Nafis Tahmid**, **Ahmed Rumi**, and **Anwarul Bashir Shuaib** ‚Äî for their outstanding mentorship, lectures, and continued encouragement throughout the *CSE310: Compiler Design* course.
- **The creators of Flex (Fast Lexical Analyzer Generator)** ‚Äî for providing an efficient tool to build our lexer with minimal hassle.
- **The ANTLR (Another Tool for Language Recognition) community** ‚Äî for making grammar-driven parsing intuitive, powerful, and accessible.
- To all of my peers who offered feedback, testing support, and discussions during development.

I'm sincerely grateful for your contributions to this learning journey.
